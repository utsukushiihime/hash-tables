# Hash Tables

The Hash Tables lesson has two related myGA modules. The first module introduces the concept of hash tables through an analogy, in an easy-to-understand way, while the second module gets into more of the technical, nitty-gritty parts of hash tables.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

- Define hash functions and hash tables.
- Articulate the benefits of hash tables as they relate to speed of data access.
- Define collisions and how to resolve them.

## Prerequisites

- Big O Notation
- myGA Module 1: Introduction to Hash Tables
- myGA Module 2: Hash Tables Deep Dive

## Additional Resources

- Handy visualizations for a [closed addressing hash table](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/OpenHash.html) and an [open addressing hash table](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ClosedHash.html).
- Twenty fun interview questions, all related to [various hashing techniques](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-20-hashing-technique-based-interview-questions/).

# Deliverables

## One Paragraph Explanation of Hash Tables

Hash tables are used to store key-value pairs.

They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.

Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations: finding values, adding new values, and removing values.
